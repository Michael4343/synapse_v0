# Password Reset Flow Fix - September 16, 2025

## Issue Summary
The password reset feature was sending emails successfully but users couldn't actually update their passwords. The system was logging users in automatically instead of showing the password reset form.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Production URL Issue
- The `getSiteUrl()` function wasn't properly using the production URL from environment variables
- Reset emails were being sent with localhost URLs even in production
- **Log Evidence**: Emails always redirected to localhost instead of `https://synapse-v0.vercel.app`

### Problem 2: Code Parameter Flow
- Supabase sends password reset links with a `code` parameter: `/?code=38e0c679-ff4e-4513-ba61-e3c65936acef`
- Main page was automatically logging users in and redirecting to `/dashboard`
- Users never saw the password reset form
- **Log Evidence**: `GET /?code=38e0c679-ff4e-4513-ba61-e3c65936acef 200` → `GET /dashboard 200`

### Problem 3: Missing Code Exchange
- Reset page was only listening for `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` event
- No handling for direct code parameter exchange
- Code wasn't being properly exchanged for an authenticated session

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed URL Generation (`src/app/login/actions.ts`)
```typescript
async function getSiteUrl() {
  // Always prioritize environment variable for production deployments
  if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL) {
    return process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL
  }

  // Fallback to constructing from request headers (development only)
  const headersList = await headers()
  const host = headersList.get('host')
  const protocol = headersList.get('x-forwarded-proto') || (host?.includes('localhost') ? 'http' : 'https')

  return `${protocol}://${host}`
}
```

**Impact**: Reset emails now use production URL `https://synapse-v0.vercel.app` instead of localhost.

### 2. Added Code Detection (`src/app/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Check for password reset code before doing anything else
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)
const resetCode = urlParams.get('code')

if (resetCode) {
  // User clicked password reset link - redirect to reset page with code
  router.push(`/reset-password?code=${resetCode}`)
  return
}
```

**Impact**: Users with reset codes are now redirected to the password reset form instead of the dashboard.

### 3. Enhanced Reset Page (`src/app/reset-password/page.tsx`)
```typescript
const handlePasswordResetCode = async () => {
  if (resetCode) {
    // Exchange the code for a session
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(resetCode)

    if (error) {
      // Handle expired/invalid codes
      setError('Password reset link has expired. Please request a new one.')
    } else if (data.session) {
      // Successfully exchanged code for session
      setShowPasswordForm(true)
      setError('')
    }
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Reset page now properly exchanges codes for authenticated sessions and shows the password form.

## New Password Reset Flow

### Before Fix:
1. User requests reset → Email sent with localhost URL
2. User clicks email → Arrives at `/?code=...`
3. Main page logs user in → Redirects to `/dashboard`
4. **User never sees password reset form**

### After Fix:
1. User requests reset → Email sent with production URL
2. User clicks email → Arrives at `/?code=...`
3. Main page detects code → Redirects to `/reset-password?code=...`
4. Reset page exchanges code → Shows password form
5. User updates password → Success!

## Testing Results

### TypeScript Compilation
- ✅ No TypeScript errors (`npm run typecheck` passes)
- ✅ All imports and types correctly resolved

### Build Process
- ✅ Production build compiles successfully
- ⚠️ Minor Supabase middleware warnings (expected and harmless)

### Expected Log Flow (After Fix):
```
POST / 303 in 6575ms                          # Password reset request
GET /?message=If+an+account... 200 in 1069ms  # Success message shown
GET /?code=38e0c679... 200 in 652ms           # User clicks email link
GET /reset-password?code=... 200 in XXXXms    # Redirected to reset form
POST /reset-password 303 in XXXXms            # Password updated
GET /?message=Password+updated... 200 in XXXms # Success message
```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/app/login/actions.ts`** - Fixed URL generation to prioritize production environment variable
2. **`src/app/page.tsx`** - Added password reset code detection and redirect logic
3. **`src/app/reset-password/page.tsx`** - Enhanced to handle code-based password reset flow
4. **`docs/password-reset-fix-sept-16-2025.md`** - This documentation file

## Error Handling Improvements

### Expired/Invalid Codes
- Clear error messages: "Password reset link has expired. Please request a new one."
- Automatic URL cleanup to remove invalid codes
- Fallback to standard PASSWORD_RECOVERY event handling

### Edge Cases
- Network errors during code exchange
- Missing or malformed codes
- Session conflicts

## Security Considerations

- ✅ Codes are single-use and time-limited by Supabase
- ✅ Proper session validation before password updates
- ✅ URL cleanup prevents code reuse
- ✅ Error messages don't leak sensitive information

## Future Improvements

1. **Rate Limiting**: Add client-side rate limiting for password reset requests
2. **Enhanced UX**: Add progress indicators during code exchange
3. **Analytics**: Track password reset completion rates
4. **Testing**: Add automated tests for password reset flow
